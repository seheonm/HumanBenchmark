Human Benchmark, CS351L Project 2

Hello! My name is Marina Seheon and this is my Human Benchmark for Project 2 in CS351L.

Functionality: 
I made a program similar to the human benchmark website for games. I made the 8 games. First, you enter your name to get started. Then a screen shows up where you can pick from 9 games (Reaction Time, Sequence Memory, Aim Trainer, Number Memory, Verbal Memory, Chimp Test, Visual Memory, Typing, and Number) what you want to play. 
Reaction Time is where you have to wait for the screen to turn green, once it turns green then you click on the screen and it will tell you how long it took for you to react and click the green.
Sequence Memory is you click the squares in the order that they blink after they are done with their pattern. The more you keep going, the longer the pattern gets. You have 3 lives.
Aim Trainer is where you click the box where ever it goes on the screen as fast as you can for 30 clicks. After 30 clicks, it will tell you how long you took. 
Number Memory is where you see a number for a while. After a while, the number will go away and you are asked to write the number that you saw. After each turn the number difficulty increases.
Verbal Memory is when you are given a word and you have to identify if you saw the word before or if it's a new word. You have 3 lives.
Chimp Test is where you are given boxes, with numbers in the middle (They are a little difficult to see), you have to click the boxes in the correct order of the numbers. The first round is simple there are 4 boxes and the numbers stay in the middle. After you pass this round it gets more difficult, more boxes appear and once you click on the first box, the numbers in the middle of the boxes disappear and you have to remember the correct order of the boxes. 
Visual Memory is where you need to click the boxes in the correct order that they show up. You have 3 lives. 
Typing is where you are given a long sentence to type to test your speed of typing. You need to type the sentence exactly as it is shown in order to finish the game, if there is a mistake in your typing then you cannot finish the game, then the time it took you to write the sentence will be shown to you. 
Number is a game that I created. You are shown a long number and you have to write down the number shown correct to move on.
In all the games you have the option to save your score and/or try again. You can also use the back button to go back to the main screen.

Extra Credit:
I made the games very similar to the actual website except I didn't implement all of the colors.

Possible bugs: 
Sometimes the visual memory and number game don't work correctly but usually they're fine.
