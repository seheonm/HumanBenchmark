Human Benhcmark, CS351L Project 2

Hello! My name is Marina Seheon and this is my Human Benchmark for Project 2 in CS351L.

Functionality: 
I made a program similar to the human benchmark website for games. I made the 8 games. First, you enter your name to get started. Then a screen shows up where you can pick from 9 games (Reaction Time, Sequence Memory, Aim Trainer, Number Memory, Verbal Memory, Chimp Test, Visual Memory, Typing,a dn Reverse Number) what you want to play. 
Reaction Time is where you have to wait for the screen to turn green, once it turns green then you click on the screen and it will tell you how long it took for you to react and click the green. You can keep going if you like or if you click to early, you can try again.
Sequence Memory 

Extra Credit:


Possible bugs: 
Sometimes the red color goes out of range- this gives an error in the terminal, but the program still runs fine.
